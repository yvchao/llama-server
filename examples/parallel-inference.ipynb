      "1. Define your website's purpose and goals: Before you start building your website, you need to determine its purpose and what you want to achieve with it. What is the main message you want to convey? Who is your target audience? What do you want visitors to do when they visit your site?\n",

      "1. The Babylonian method: This is one of the oldest methods for calculating $\\pi$, and it involves inscribing and circumscribing polygons around a circle and then calculating their perimeters.
